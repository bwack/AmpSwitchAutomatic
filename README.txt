Amp Switch Automatic,
6 amplifiers connected to one pair of stereo speakers with
automatic switching.

Realized with 1970-80s digital logic technology on two stripboards, and
a project box with 28 speaker terminals on it and a 5V power input.

Cheepo auto 1:1 600:600 ohm audio transformers were used to galvanically
isolate the amplifiers, and to pass audio to the detector circuits (lm339).
The relays switch the amplifiers in one at a time. If there is audio on
more than one amplifier, the amp switch sticks to the currently switched amp,
just to keep the box from switching too much. It is not intended to mix,
just switch though.
